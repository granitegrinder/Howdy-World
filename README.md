Hi Folks, My name is Anthony Hugo Almanza, and you can call me Hugo. I'm interested in learning more about front end web development and I'd love to eventually dabble in some more back end languages. I'm open to learning new ideas and being a sounding board for yours. Feel free to contact me anytime. 

Thank you,

Hugo
